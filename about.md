## Summary 
I am an integrous and driven researcher with a passion for making sense of difficult data. I am enthusiastic about utilizing skills/knowledge in collaboration, analysis, python scripting, and human decision making to accelerate the success of my team in the traversal of ambiguous problem spaces via data driven solutions. I strive to progress without compromising the validity of my work.

## Background
I have earned my Bachelor of Science from the University of California Irvine where I completed coursework involving statistics, psychology, and computer science. While completing my degree I achieved honors in the school of social science where I completed a complex and novel research project from beginning to end. This project involved the investigation and modeling of human and machine learning decision making in difficult feature spaces. This education and my personal pursuits have instilled me with an interest in analyzing data and developing a stronger understanding of how people, data, and machine learning can all come together.

## Interests
I hope to utilize the domains within Cognitive Science to approach how people and data coexist with an unorthodox perspective. In essence, bringing together psychology, decision making, and cognition with data, statistics, and machine learning through the language of programming. Eventually, using the knowledge that comes with time to develop a strong foundation from which to provide insight and drive the direction of my team and my work to positive benefit.
